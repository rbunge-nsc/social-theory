# social-theory

Awhile ago I set out to create a synthesis of social theory that would reflect my sense of a good way to conduct adult education in our current situation. A bit into that project, I realized a more pertinent goal would be assist my students in constructing their own theoretical perspectives. The general goal of my pedagogy is "liberation", in the sense that students must learn to think for themselves. In line with that goal, then, I decided to forego any attempts at grand synthesis and instead to create some raw materials that students may find useful for informing their own thinking.
